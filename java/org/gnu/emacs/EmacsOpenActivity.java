/* This class makes the Emacs server work reasonably on Android.

   There is no way to make the Unix socket publicly available on
   Android.

   Instead, this activity tries to connect to the Emacs server, to
   make it open files the system asks Emacs to open, and to emulate
   some reasonable behavior when Emacs has not yet started.

   First, Emacs registers itself as an application that can open text
   and image files.

   Then, when the user is asked to open a file and selects ``Emacs''
   as the application that will open the file, the system pops up a
   window, this activity, and calls the `onCreate' function.

   `onCreate' then tries very to find the file name of the file that
   was selected, and give it to emacsclient.

   If emacsclient successfully opens the file, then this activity
   starts EmacsActivity (to bring it on to the screen); otherwise, it
   displays the output of emacsclient or any error message that occurs
   and exits.  */
