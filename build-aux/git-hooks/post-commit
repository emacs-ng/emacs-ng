### Commentary:

# This hook runs after a commit is finalized and checks that the files
# mentioned in the commit message match the diff.  We perform this in
# the post-commit phase so that we can be sure we properly detect all
# the files in the diff (this is difficult during the commit-msg hook,
# since there's no cross-platform way to detect when a commit is being
# amended).

# However, since this is a post-commit hook, it's too late to error
# out and abort the commit: it's already done!  As a result, this hook
# is purely advisory, and instead we error out when trying to push
# (see "pre-push" in this directory).

### Code:

HOOKS_DIR=`dirname "$0"`

# Prefer gawk if available, as it handles NUL bytes properly.
if type gawk >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  awk="gawk"
else
  awk="awk"
fi
