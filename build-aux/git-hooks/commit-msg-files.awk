### Commentary:

# This script accepts a list of (unabbreviated) Git commit SHAs, and
# will then iterate over them to check that any files mentioned in the
# commit message are actually present in the commit's diff.  If not,
# it will print out the incorrect file names and return 1.

# You can also pass "-v reason=pre-push", which will add more-verbose
# output, indicating the abbreviated commit SHA and first line of the
# commit message for any improper commits.
