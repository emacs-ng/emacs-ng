  "When non-nil, skip the detection of mixed-versions situations.
For internal use only.  See Emacs bug #62762.
This variable is only supposed to be changed by Emacs build scripts.
When nil, Org tries to detect when Org source files were compiled with
a different version of Org (which tends to lead to incorrect `.elc' files),
or when the current Emacs session has loaded a mix of files from different
Org versions (typically the one bundled with Emacs and another one installed
from GNU ELPA), which can happen if some parts of Org were loaded before
`load-path' was changed (e.g. before the GNU-ELPA-installed Org is activated
by `package-activate-all').")

  "Assert compile time and runtime version match."
  ;; We intentionally use a more permissive `org-release' instead of
  ;; `org-git-version' to work around deficiencies in Elisp
  ;; compilation after pulling latest changes.  Unchanged files will
  ;; not be re-compiled and thus their macro-expanded
  ;; `org-assert-version' calls would fail using strict
  ;; `org-git-version' check because the generated Org version strings
  ;; will not match.

     (warn "Org version mismatch.
This warning usually appears when a built-in Org version is loaded
prior to the more recent Org version.

Version mismatch is commonly encountered in the following situations:

1. Emacs is loaded using literate Org config and more recent Org
   version is loaded inside the file loaded by `org-babel-load-file'.
   `org-babel-load-file' triggers the built-in Org version clashing
   the newer Org version attempt to be loaded later.

   It is recommended to move the Org loading code before the
   `org-babel-load-file' call.

2. New Org version is loaded manually by setting `load-path', but some
   other package depending on Org is loaded before the `load-path' is
   configured.
   This \"other package\" is triggering built-in Org version, again
   causing the version mismatch.

   It is recommended to set `load-path' as early in the config as
   possible.

3. New Org version is loaded using straight.el package manager and
   other package depending on Org is loaded before straight triggers
   loading of the newer Org version.

   It is recommended to put

    %s

   early in the config.  Ideally, right after the straight.el
   bootstrap.  Moving `use-package' :straight declaration may not be
   sufficient if the corresponding `use-package' statement is
   deferring the loading.

4. A new Org version is synchronized with Emacs git repository and
   stale .elc files are still left from the previous build.

   It is recommended to remove .elc files from lisp/org directory and
   re-compile."

;; We rely on org-macs when generating Org version.  Checking Org

a file with the same basename and directory as SOURCE but with the

Failure to produce this file will be interpreted as PROCESS failing.

If PROCESS is a function, it is called with a single argument:
the SOURCE file.

If PROCESS is a list of commands, each of them is called using
`shell-command'.  By default, in each command, %b, %f, %F, %o and
%O are replaced with, respectively, SOURCE base name, relative
file name, absolute file name, relative directory and absolute
output file name.  It is possible, however, to use more
place-holders by specifying them in optional argument SPEC, as an
alist following the pattern

  (CHARACTER . REPLACEMENT-STRING).
