;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements Org abstract syntax tree (AST) data structure.
;;
;; Only the most generic aspects of the syntax tree are considered
;; below.  The fine details of Org syntax are implemented elsewhere.
;;
;; Org AST is composed of nested syntax nodes.
;; Within actual Org syntax, the nodes can be either headings,
;; elements, or objects.  However, historically, we often call syntax
;; nodes simply "elements", unless the context requires clarification
;; about the node type.  In particular, many functions below will have
;; naming pattern `org-element-X', implying `org-element-node-X' --
;; they will apply to all the node types, not just to elements.
;;
;; 1. Syntax nodes
;; ------------------
;; Each Org syntax node can be represented as a string or list.
;;
;; The main node representation follows the pattern
;; (TYPE PROPERTIES CONTENTS), where
;;   TYPE is a symbol describing the node type.
;;   PROPERTIES is the property list attached to it.
;;   CONTENTS is a list of child syntax nodes contained within the
;;            current node, when applicable.
;;
;;; For example, "*bold text*  " node can be represented as
;;
;;    (bold (:begin 1 :end 14 :post-blank 2 ...) "bold text")
;;
;; TYPE can be any symbol, including symbol not explicitly defined by
;; Org syntax.  If TYPE is not a part of the syntax, the syntax
;; node is called "pseudo element/object", but otherwise considered a
;; valid part of Org syntax tree.  Search "Pseudo objects and
;; elements" in lisp/ox-latex.el for an example of using pseudo
;; elements.
;;
;; PROPERTIES is a property list (:property1 value1 :property2 value2 ...)
;; holding properties and value.
;;
;; `:standard-properties', `:parent', `:deferred', and `:secondary'
;; properties are treated specially in the code below.
;;
;; `:standard-properties' holds an array with
;; `org-element--standard-properties' values, in the same order.  The
;; values in the array have priority over the same properties
;; specified in the property list.  You should not rely on the value
;; of `org-element--standard-properties' in the code.
;; `:standard-properties' may or may not be actually present in
;; PROPERTIES.  It is mostly used to speed up property access in
;; performance-critical code, as most of the code requesting property
;; values by constant name is inlined.
;;
;; The previous example can also be presented in more compact form as:
;;
;;    (bold (:standard-properties [1 10 ... 2 ...]) "bold text")
;;
;; Using an array allows faster access to frequently used properties.
;;
;; `:parent' holds the containing node, for a child node within the
;; AST.  It may or may not be present in PROPERTIES.
;;
;; `:secondary' holds a list of properties that may contain extra AST
;; nodes, in addition to the node contents.
;;
;; `:deferred' property describes how to update not-yet-calculated
;; properties on request.
;;
;;
;; Syntax node can also be represented by a string.  Strings always
;; represent syntax node of `plain-text' type with contents being nil
;; and properties represented as string properties at position 0.
;; `:standard-properties' are not considered for `plain-text' nodes as
;; `plain-text' nodes tend to hold much fewer properties.
;;
;; In the above example, `plain-text' node "bold text" is more
;; accurately represented as
;;
;;    #("bold text" 0 9 (:parent (bold ...)))
;;
;; with :parent property value pointing back to the containing `bold'
;; node.
;;
;; `anonymous' syntax node is represented as a list with `car'
;; containing another syntax node.  Such node has nil type, does not
;; have properties, and its contents is a list of the contained syntax
;; node.  `:parent' property of the contained nodes point back to the
;; list itself, except when `anonymous' node holds secondary value
;; (see below), in which case the `:parent' property is set to be the
;; containing node in the AST.
;;
;; Any node representation other then described above is not
;; considered as Org syntax node.
;;
;; 2. Deferred values
;; ------------------
;; Sometimes, it is computationally expensive or even not possible to
;; calculate property values when creating an AST node.  The value
;; calculation can be deferred to the time the value is requested.
;;
;; Property values and contained nodes may have a special value of
;; `org-element-deferred' type.  Such values are computed dynamically.
;; Either every time the property value is requested or just the first
;; time.  In the latter case, the `org-element-deferred' property
;; value is auto-replaced with the dynamically computed result.
;;
;; Sometimes, even property names (not just property values) cannot, or
;; should not be computed in advance.  If a special property
;; `:deferred' has the value of `org-element-deferred-type', it is
;; first resolved for side effects of setting the missing properties.
;; The resolved value is re-assigned to the `:deferred' property.
;;
;; Note that `org-element-copy' unconditionally resolves deferred
;; properties.  This is useful to generate pure (in functional sense)
;; AST.
;;
;; The properties listed in `org-element--standard-properties', except
;; `:deferred' and `:parent' are never considered to have deferred value.
;; This constraint makes org-element API significantly faster.
;;
;; 3. Org document representation
;; ------------------------------
;; Document AST is represented by nested Org syntax nodes.
;;
;; Each node in the AST can hold the contained node in its CONTENTS or
;; as values of properties.
;;
;; For example, (bold (...) "bold text") `bold' node contains
;; `plain-text' node in CONTENTS.
;;
;; The containing node is called "parent node".
;;
;; The contained nodes held inside CONTENTS are called "child nodes".
;; They must have their `:parent' property set to the containing
;; parent node.
;;
;; The contained nodes can also be held as property values.  Such
;; nodes are called "secondary nodes".  Only certain properties
;; can contribute to AST - the property names listed as the value of
;; special property `:secondary'
;;
;; For example,
;;
;;   (headline ((:secondary (:title)
;;               :title (#("text" 0 4 (:parent (headline ...)))))))
;;
;; is a parent headline node containing "text" secondary string node
;; inside `:title' property.  Note that `:title' is listed in
;; `:secondary' value.
;;
;; The following example illustrates AST structure for an Org document:
;;
;; ---- Org document --------
;; * Heading with *bold* text
;; Paragraph.
;; ---- end -----------------
;;
;; (org-data (...) ; `org-data' node.
;;   (headline
;;     (
;;      ;; `:secondary' property lists property names that contain other
;;      ;; syntax tree nodes.
;;
;;      :secondary (:title)
;;
;;      ;; `:title' property is set to anonymous node containing:
;;      ;; `plain-text', `bold', `plain-text'.
;;
;;      :title ("Heading with " (bold (:post-blank 1 ...) "bold") "text"))
;;
;;      ;; `headline' contents
;;     (section (...)
;;       (paragraph
;;         ;; `:parent' property set to the containing section.
;;         (:parent (section ...))
;;         ;; paragraph contents is a `plain-text' node.
;;         "Paragraph1."))))
;;
;; Try calling M-: (org-element-parse-buffer) on the above example Org
;; document to explore a more complete version of Org AST.
