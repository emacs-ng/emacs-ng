;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides the Completion Preview mode.  This minor mode
;; displays a completion suggestion for the symbol at point in an
;; overlay after point.  Check out the customization group
;; `completion-preview' for user options that you may want to tweak.
;;
;; To enable Completion Preview mode, use `completion-preview-mode'.
;; To accept the completion suggestion, press TAB.  If you want to
;; ignore a completion suggestion, just go on editing or moving around
;; the buffer.  Completion Preview mode continues to update the
;; suggestion as you type according to the text around point.
;;
;; The commands `completion-preview-next-candidate' and
;; `completion-preview-prev-candidate' allow you to cycle the
;; completion candidate that the preview suggests.  These commands
;; don't have a default keybinding, but you can bind them, for
;; example, to M-n and M-p in `completion-preview-active-mode-map' to
;; have them handy whenever the preview is visible.
;;
;; If you set the user option `completion-preview-exact-match-only' to
;; non-nil, Completion Preview mode only suggests a completion
;; candidate when its the only possible completion for the (partial)
;; symbol at point.  The user option `completion-preview-commands'
;; says which commands should trigger the completion preview.  The
;; user option `completion-preview-minimum-symbol-length' specifies a
;; minimum number of consecutive characters with word or symbol syntax
;; that should appear around point for Emacs to suggest a completion.
;; By default, this option is set to 3, so Emacs suggests a completion
;; if you type "foo", but typing just "fo" doesn't show the preview.
