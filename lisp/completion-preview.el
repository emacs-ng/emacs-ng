;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides the Completion Preview mode.  This minor mode
;; displays a completion suggestion for the symbol at point in an
;; overlay after point.  Check out the customization group
;; `completion-preview' for user options that you may want to tweak.
;;
;; To enable Completion Preview mode, use `completion-preview-mode'.
;; To accept the completion suggestion, press TAB.  If you want to
;; ignore a completion suggestion, just go on editing or moving around
;; the buffer.  Completion Preview mode continues to update the
;; suggestion as you type according to the text around point.
;;
;; The commands `completion-preview-next-candidate' and
;; `completion-preview-prev-candidate' allow you to cycle the
;; completion candidate that the preview suggests.  These commands
;; don't have a default keybinding, but you can bind them, for
;; example, to M-n and M-p in `completion-preview-active-mode-map' to
;; have them handy whenever the preview is visible.
;;
;; When the completion candidate that the preview is showing shares a
;; common prefix with all other candidates, Completion Preview mode
;; underlines that common prefix.  If you want to insert the common
;; prefix but with a different suffix than the one the preview is
;; showing, use the command `completion-preview-complete'.  This command
;; inserts just the common prefix and lets you go on typing as usual.
;; If you invoke `completion-preview-complete' when there is no common
;; prefix (so nothing is underlined in the preview), it displays a list
;; of all matching completion candidates.
;;
;; You can also insert only the first word of the completion candidate
;; with the command `completion-preview-insert-word'.  With a numeric
;; prefix argument, it inserts that many words instead of just the one.
;; This command is not bound by default, but you may want to bind it to
;; M-f (or remap `forward-word') in `completion-preview-active-mode-map'
;; since it's very much like a `forward-word' that also moves "into" the
;; completion preview.  To define your own command that inserts part of
;; a completion candidate by moving "into" the completion preview, use
;; the function `completion-preview-partial-insert'.  For example, you
;; can define a command that completes exactly one symbol as follows:
;;
;;   (defun my-completion-preview-insert-symbol ()
;;     (interactive)
;;     (completion-preview-partial-insert #'forward-symbol 1))
;;
;; Similarly to `completion-preview-insert-word', the command
;; `completion-preview-insert-sexp' lets you complete by one or more
;; balanced expressions.  The definition of this command is very similar
;; to the simple example above, expect it uses `forward-sexp' rather
;; than `forward-symbol'.  This command can be useful when you're using
;; Completion Preview mode with long, complex completion candidates,
;; such as entire shell commands from the shell history.
;;
;; If you set the user option `completion-preview-exact-match-only' to
;; non-nil, Completion Preview mode only suggests a completion
;; candidate when its the only possible completion for the (partial)
;; symbol at point.  The user option `completion-preview-commands'
;; says which commands should trigger the completion preview.  The
;; user option `completion-preview-minimum-symbol-length' specifies a
;; minimum number of consecutive characters with word or symbol syntax
;; that should appear around point for Emacs to suggest a completion.
;; By default, this option is set to 3, so Emacs suggests a completion
;; if you type "foo", but typing just "fo" doesn't show the preview.
;; If you want the preview to appear also after non-symbol characters,
;; such as punctuation, set `completion-preview-minimum-symbol-length'
;; to nil.  If you do so, you may want to customize the user option
;; `completion-preview-idle-delay' to have the preview appear only
;; when you pause typing for a short duration rather than after every
;; key.  Try setting it to 0.2 seconds and see how that works for you.
;;
;; By default, Completion Preview mode automatically adapts the
;; background color of the preview overlay to match the background color
;; of the buffer text it's completing.  If you prefer a distinct
;; background color for the preview, disable this feature by customizing
;; `completion-preview-adapt-background-color' to nil.
;;
;; Sometimes you may want to use Completion Preview mode alongside other
;; Emacs features that place an overlay after point, in a way that could
;; "compete" with the preview overlay.  In such cases, you should give
;; the completion preview overlay a higher priority, so it properly
;; appears immediately after point, before other overlays.  To do that,
;; set the variable `completion-preview-overlay-priority'.  You can set
;; it buffer-locally if you only use competing overlays in some buffers.
;; In particular, an important use case for this variable is enabling
;; Completion Preview mode for `M-:' and other minibuffers that support
;; `completion-at-point'.  In the minibuffer, some message are displayed
;; using an overlay that may, by default, conflict with the completion
;; preview overlay.  Use `completion-preview-overlay-priority' to
;; resolve this conflict by giving the completion preview overlay a
;; higher priority:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (setq-local completion-preview-overlay-priority 1200)
;;               (completion-preview-mode)))
