;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides code to recognize simple touch screen gestures.
;; It is used on X and Android, currently the only systems where Emacs
;; supports touch input.
;;
;; See (elisp)Touchscreen Events for a description of the details of
;; touch events.

;;; Code:

(defvar touch-screen-current-tool nil
  "The touch point currently being tracked, or nil.
If non-nil, this is a list of ten elements: the ID of the touch
point being tracked, the window where the touch began, a cons
holding the last registered position of the touch point, relative
to that window, a field used to store data while tracking the
touch point, the initial position of the touchpoint, another four
fields to used store data while tracking the touch point, and the
last known position of the touch point.

See `touch-screen-handle-point-update' and
`touch-screen-handle-point-up' for the meanings of the fourth
element.

The third and last elements differ in that the former is not
modified until after a gesture is recognized in reaction to an
update, whereas the latter is updated upon each apposite
`touchscreen-update' event.")

(defvar touch-screen-aux-tool nil
  "The ancillary tool being tracked, or nil.
If non-nil, this is a vector of ten elements: the ID of the
touch point being tracked, the window where the touch began, a
cons holding the initial position of the touch point, and the
last known position of the touch point, all in the same format as
in `touch-screen-current-tool', the distance in pixels between
the current tool and the aforementioned initial position, the
center of the line formed between those two points, the ratio
between the present distance between both tools and the aforesaid
initial distance when a pinch gesture was last sent, and three
elements into which commands can save data particular to a tool.

The ancillary tool is a second tool whose movement is interpreted
in unison with that of the current tool to recognize gestures
comprising the motion of both such as \"pinch\" gestures, in
which the text scale is adjusted in proportion to the distance
between both tools.")
