;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains generic infrastructure for dealing with
;; projects, some utility functions, and commands using that
;; infrastructure.
;;
;; The goal is to make it easier for Lisp programs to operate on the
;; current project, without having to know which package handles
;; detection of that project type, parsing its config files, etc.
;;
;; This file consists of following parts:
;;
;; Infrastructure (the public API):
;;
;; Function `project-current' that returns the current project
;; instance based on the value of the hook `project-find-functions',
;; and several generic functions that act on it.
;;
;; `project-root' must be defined for every project.
;; `project-files' can be overridden for performance purposes.
;; `project-ignores' and `project-external-roots' describe the project
;; files and its relations to external directories.  `project-files'
;; should be consistent with `project-ignores'.
;;
;; `project-buffers' can be overridden if the project has some unusual
;; shape (e.g. it contains files residing outside of its root, or some
;; files inside the root must not be considered a part of it).  It
;; should be consistent with `project-files'.
;;
;; This list can change in future versions.
;;
;; Transient project:
;;
;; An instance of this type can be returned by `project-current' if no
;; project was detected automatically, and the user had to pick a
;; directory manually.  The fileset it describes is the whole
;; directory, with the exception of some standard ignored files and
;; directories.  This type has little purpose otherwise, as the only
;; generic function it provides an override for is `project-root'.
;;
;; VC-aware project:
;;
;; Originally conceived as an example implementation, now it's a
;; relatively fast backend that delegates to 'git ls-files' or 'hg
;; status' to list the project's files.  It honors the VC ignore
;; files, but supports additions to the list using the user option
;; `project-vc-ignores' (usually through .dir-locals.el).  See the
;; customization group `project-vc' for other options that control its
;; behavior.
;;
;; If the repository is using any other VCS than Git or Hg, the file
;; listing uses the default mechanism based on `find-program'.
;;
;; This project type can also be used for non-VCS controlled
;; directories, see the variable `project-vc-extra-root-markers'.
;;
;; Utils:
;;
;; `project-combine-directories' and `project-subtract-directories',
;; mainly for use in the abovementioned generics' implementations.
;;
;; `project-known-project-roots' and `project-remember-project' to
;; interact with the "known projects" list.
;;
;; Commands:
;;
;; `project-prefix-map' contains the full list of commands defined in
;; this package.  This map uses the prefix `C-x p' by default.
;; Type `C-x p f' to find file in the current project.
;; Type `C-x p C-h' to see all available commands and bindings.
;;
;; All commands defined in this package are implemented using the
;; public API only.  As a result, they will work with any project
;; backend that follows the protocol.
;;
;; Any third-party code that wants to use this package should likewise
;; target the public API.  Use any of the built-in commands as the
;; example.
;;
;; How to create a new backend:
;;
;; - Consider whether you really should, or whether there are other
;; ways to reach your goals.  If the backend's performance is
;; significantly lower than that of the built-in one, and it's first
;; in the list, it will affect all commands that use it.  Unless you
;; are going to be using it only yourself or in special circumstances,
;; you will probably want it to be fast, and it's unlikely to be a
;; trivial endeavor.  `project-files' is the method to optimize (the
;; default implementation gets slower the more files the directory
;; has, and the longer the list of ignores is).
;;
;; - Choose the format of the value that represents a project for your
;; backend (we call it project instance).  Don't use any of the
;; formats from other backends.  The format can be arbitrary, as long
;; as the datatype is something `cl-defmethod' can dispatch on.  The
;; value should be stable (when compared with `equal') across
;; invocations, meaning calls to that function from buffers belonging
;; to the same project should return equal values.
;;
;; - Write a new function that will determine the current project
;; based on the directory and add it to `project-find-functions'
;; (which see) using `add-hook'.  It is a good idea to depend on the
;; directory only, and not on the current major mode, for example.
;; Because the usual expectation is that all files in the directory
;; belong to the same project (even if some/most of them are ignored).
;;
;; - Define new methods for some or all generic functions for this
;; backend using `cl-defmethod'.  A `project-root' method is
;; mandatory, `project-files' is recommended, the rest are optional.

;;; TODO:

;; * Reliably cache the list of files in the project, probably using
;;   filenotify.el (if supported) to invalidate.  And avoiding caching
;;   if it's not available (manual cache invalidation is not nice).
;;
;; * Build tool related functionality.  Start with a `project-build'
;;   command, which should provide completions on tasks to run, and
;;   maybe allow entering some additional arguments.  This might
;;   be handled better with a separate API, though.  Then we won't
;;   force every project backend to be aware of the build tool(s) the
;;   project is using.
;;
;; * Command to (re)build the tag files in all project roots.  To that
;;   end, we might need to add a way to provide file whitelist
;;   wildcards for each root to limit etags to certain files (in
;;   addition to the blacklist provided by ignores), and/or allow
;;   specifying additional tag regexps.
;;
;; * UI for the user to be able to pick the current project for the
;;   whole Emacs session, independent of the current directory.  Or,
;;   in the more advanced case, open a set of projects, and have some
;;   project-related commands to use them all.  E.g., have a command
;;   to search for a regexp across all open projects.
;;
;; * Support for project-local variables: a UI to edit them, and a
;;   utility function to retrieve a value.  Probably useless without
;;   support in various built-in commands.  In the API, we might get
;;   away with only adding a `project-configuration-directory' method,
;;   defaulting to the project root the current file/buffer is in.
;;   And prompting otherwise.  How to best mix that with backends that
;;   want to set/provide certain variables themselves, is up for
;;   discussion.

  * `derived-mode': the buffer is killed if the buffer's major

  * `and': the cdr is a list of recursive conditions, that all have
    to be met.
  * `or': the cdr is a list of recursive conditions, of which at
    least one has to be met.
