;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains functions that can be shared by C-like language
;; major modes, like indenting and filling "/* */" block comments.
;;
;; For indenting and filling comments:
;;
;; - Use `c-ts-common-comment-setup' to setup comment variables and
;;   filling.
;;
;; - Use simple-indent matcher `c-ts-common-looking-at-star' and
;;   anchor `c-ts-common-comment-start-after-first-star' for indenting
;;   block comments.  See `c-ts-mode--indent-styles' for example.
;;
;; For indenting statements:
;;
;; - Set `c-ts-common-indent-offset', and
;;   `c-ts-common-indent-type-regexp-alist', then use simple-indent
;;   offset `c-ts-common-statement-offset' in
;;   `treesit-simple-indent-rules'.

  "Baseline indent rule for C-like languages.

NODE PARENT, BOL are like in other simple indent rules.

This rule works as follows:

Let PREV-NODE be the largest node that starts on previous line,
basically the NODE we get if we were indenting previous line.

0. Closing brace aligns with first parent that starts on a new line.

1. If PREV-NODE and NODE are siblings, align this line to previous
line (PREV-NODE as the anchor, and offset is 0).

2. If PARENT is a list, ie, (...) [...], align with NODE's first
sibling.  For the first sibling and the closing paren or bracket, indent
according to `c-ts-common-list-indent-style'.  This rule also handles
initializer lists like {...}, but initializer lists doesn't respect
`c-ts-common-list-indent-style'--they always indent in the `simple'
style.

3. Otherwise, go up the parse tree from NODE and look for a parent that
starts on a new line.  Use that parent as the anchor and indent one
level.  But if the node is a top-level construct (ignoring preprocessor
nodes), don't indent it.

This rule works for a wide range of scenarios including complex
situations.  Major modes should use this as the fallback rule, and add
exception rules before it to cover the cases it doesn't apply.

This rule tries to be smart and ignore proprocessor node in some
situations.  By default, any node that has \"proproc\" in its type are
considered a preprocessor node.  If that heuristic is inaccurate, define
a `preproc' thing in `treesit-thing-settings', and this rule will use
the thing definition instead."
