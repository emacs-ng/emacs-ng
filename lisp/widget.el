;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The widget library is partially documented in the `widget' Info
;; file.
;;
;; This file only contains the code needed to define new widget types.
;; Everything else is autoloaded from `wid-edit.el'.

;;; Code:

(defmacro define-widget-keywords (&rest _keys)
  (declare (obsolete nil "27.1") (indent defun))
  nil)

(defun define-widget (name class doc &rest args)
  "Define a new widget type named NAME from CLASS.

NAME and CLASS should both be symbols, CLASS should be one of the
existing widget types, or nil to create the widget from scratch.

After the new widget has been defined, the following two calls will
create identical widgets:

* (widget-create NAME)

* (apply #\\='widget-create CLASS ARGS)

The third argument DOC is a documentation string for the widget."
  (declare (doc-string 3) (indent defun))
  (unless (or (null doc) (stringp doc))
    (error "Widget documentation must be nil or a string"))
  (put name 'widget-type (cons class args))
  (put name 'widget-documentation (purecopy doc))
  name)

(define-obsolete-function-alias 'widget-plist-member #'plist-member "26.1")

(provide 'widget)
