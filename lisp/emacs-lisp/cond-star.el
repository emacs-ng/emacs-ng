;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements `cond*', an alternative to `pcase'.

;; Here is the list of functions the generated code is known to call:
;; car, cdr, car-safe, cdr-safe, nth, nthcdr, null, eq, equal, eql, =,
;; vectorp, length.
;; It also uses these control and binding primitives:
;; and, or, if, progn, let, let*, setq.
;; For regexp matching only, it can call string-match and match-string.

;; ??? If a clause starts with a keyword,
;; should the element after the keyword be treated in the usual way
;; as a pattern?  Currently `cond*-non-exit-clause-substance' explicitly
;; prevents that by adding t at the front of its value.

(defmacro cond* (&rest clauses)
  "Extended form of traditional Lisp `cond' construct.
A `cond*' construct is a series of clauses, and a clause
normally has the form (CONDITION BODY...).

CONDITION can be a Lisp expression, as in `cond'.
Or it can be one of `(pcase* PATTERN DATUM)',
`(bind* BINDINGS...)', or `(match* PATTERN DATUM)',

`(pcase* PATTERN DATUM)' means to match DATUM against the
pattern PATTERN, using the same pattern syntax as `pcase'.
The condition counts as true if PATTERN matches DATUM.

`(bind* BINDINGS...)' means to bind BINDINGS (as if they were in `let*')
for the body of the clause.  As a condition, it counts as true
if the first binding's value is non-nil.  All the bindings are made
unconditionally for whatever scope they cover.

`(match* PATTERN DATUM)' is an alternative to `pcase*' that uses another
syntax for its patterns, see `match*'.

When a clause's condition is true, and it exits the `cond*'
or is the last clause, the value of the last expression
in its body becomes the return value of the `cond*' construct.

Non-exit clause:

If a clause has only one element, or if its first element is
a `bind*' clause, this clause never exits the `cond*' construct.
Instead, control always falls through to the next clause (if any).
All bindings made in CONDITION for the BODY of the non-exit clause
are passed along to the rest of the clauses in this `cond*' construct.

\\[match*\\] for documentation of the patterns for use in `match*'."
  (cond*-convert clauses))

(defmacro match* (pattern _datum)
  "This specifies matching DATUM against PATTERN.
It is not really a Lisp function, and it is meaningful
only in the CONDITION of a `cond*' clause.

`_' matches any value.
KEYWORD matches that keyword.
nil  matches nil.
t    matches t.
SYMBOL matches any value and binds SYMBOL to that value.
  If SYMBOL has been matched and bound earlier in this pattern,
  it matches here the same value that it matched before.
REGEXP matches a string if REGEXP matches it.
  The match must cover the entire string from its first char to its last.
ATOM (meaning any other kind of non-list not described above)
  matches anything `equal' to it.
\(rx REGEXP) uses a regexp specified in s-expression form,
  as in the function `rx', and matches the data that way.
\(rx REGEXP SYM0 SYM1...) uses a regexp specified in s-expression form,
  and binds the symbols SYM0, SYM1, and so on
  to (match-string 0 DATUM), (match-string 1 DATUM), and so on.
  You can use as many SYMs as regexp matching supports.

`OBJECT  matches any value `equal' to OBJECT.
\(cons CARPAT CDRPAT)
  matches a cons cell if CARPAT matches its car and CDRPAT matches its cdr.
\(list ELTPATS...)
  matches a list if the ELTPATS match its elements.
  The first ELTPAT should match the list's first element.
  The second ELTPAT should match the list's second element.  And so on.
\(vector ELTPATS...)
  matches a vector if the ELTPATS match its elements.
  The first ELTPAT should match the vector's first element.
  The second ELTPAT should match the vector's second element.  And so on.
\(cdr PATTERN)  matches PATTERN with strict checking of cdrs.
  That means that `list' patterns verify that the final cdr is nil.
  Strict checking is the default.
\(cdr-safe PATTERN)  matches PATTERN with lax checking of cdrs.
  That means that `list' patterns do not examine the final cdr.
\(and CONJUNCTS...)  matches each of the CONJUNCTS against the same data.
  If all of them match, this pattern succeeds.
  If one CONJUNCT fails, this pattern fails and does not try more CONJUNCTS.
\(or DISJUNCTS...)  matches each of the DISJUNCTS against the same data.
  If one DISJUNCT succeeds, this pattern succeeds
  and does not try more DISJUNCTs.
  If all of them fail, this pattern fails.
\(COND*-EXPANDER ...)
  Here the car is a symbol that has a `cond*-expander' property
  which defines how to handle it in a pattern.  The property value
  is a function.  Trying to match such a pattern calls that
  function with one argument, the pattern in question (including its car).
  The function should return an equivalent pattern
  to be matched instead.
\(PREDICATE SYMBOL)
  matches datum if (PREDICATE DATUM) is true,
  then binds SYMBOL to DATUM.
\(PREDICATE SYMBOL MORE-ARGS...)
  matches datum if (PREDICATE DATUM MORE-ARGS...) is true,
  then binds SYMBOL to DATUM.
  MORE-ARGS... can refer to symbols bound earlier in the pattern.
\(constrain SYMBOL EXP)
  matches datum if the form EXP is true.
  EXP can refer to symbols bound earlier in the pattern."
