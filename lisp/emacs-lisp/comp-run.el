;;; Commentary:

;; While the main native compiler is implemented in comp.el, when
;; commonly used as a jit compiler it is only loaded by Emacs sub
;; processes performing async compilation.  This file contains all
;; the code needed to drive async compilations and any Lisp code
;; needed at runtime to run native code.

When native compilation happens asynchronously, it can produce
warnings and errors, some of which might not be emitted by a
byte-compilation.  The typical case for that is native-compiling
a file that is missing some `require' of a necessary feature,
while having it already loaded into the environment when
byte-compiling.

As asynchronous native compilation always starts from a pristine
environment, it is more sensitive to such omissions, and might be
unable to compile such Lisp source files correctly.

Set this variable to nil to suppress warnings altogether, or to
the symbol `silent' to log warnings but not pop up the *Warnings*
buffer."

  "Compile FILES asynchronously.
FILES is one filename or a list of filenames or directories.

If optional argument RECURSIVELY is non-nil, recurse into
subdirectories of given directories.

If optional argument LOAD is non-nil, request to load the file
after compiling.

The optional argument SELECTOR has the following valid values:

nil -- Select all files.
a string -- A regular expression selecting files with matching names.
a function -- A function selecting files with matching names.

The variable `native-comp-async-jobs-number' specifies the number
of (commands) to run simultaneously.

LOAD can also be the symbol `late'.  This is used internally if
the byte code has already been loaded when this function is
called.  It means that we request the special kind of load
necessary in that situation, called \"late\" loading.

During a \"late\" load, instead of executing all top-level forms
of the original files, only function definitions are
loaded (paying attention to have these effective only if the
bytecode definition was not changed in the meantime)."
