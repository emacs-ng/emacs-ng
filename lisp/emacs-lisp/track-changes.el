;;; Commentary:

;; This library is a layer of abstraction above `before-change-functions'
;; and `after-change-functions' which takes care of accumulating changes
;; until a time when its client finds it convenient to react to them.
;;
;; It provides an API that is easier to use correctly than our
;; `*-change-functions' hooks.  Problems that it claims to solve:
;;
;; - Before and after calls are not necessarily paired.
;; - The beg/end values don't always match.
;; - There's usually only one call to the hooks per command but
;;   there can be thousands of calls from within a single command,
;;   so naive users will tend to write code that performs poorly
;;   in those rare cases.
;; - The hooks are run at a fairly low-level so there are things they
;;   really shouldn't do, such as modify the buffer or wait.
;; - The after call doesn't get enough info to rebuild the before-change state,
;;   so some callers need to use both before-c-f and after-c-f (and then
;;   deal with the first two points above).
;;
;; The new API is almost like `after-change-functions' except that:
;; - It provides the "before string" (i.e. the previous content of
;;   the changed area) rather than only its length.
;; - It can combine several changes into larger ones.
;; - Clients do not have to process changes right away, instead they
;;   can let changes accumulate (by combining them into a larger change)
;;   until it is convenient for them to process them.
;; - By default, changes are signaled at most once per command.

;; The API consists in the following functions:
;;
;;     (track-changes-register SIGNAL &key NOBEFORE DISJOINT IMMEDIATE)
;;     (track-changes-fetch ID FUNC)
;;     (track-changes-unregister ID)
;;
;; A typical use case might look like:
;;
;;     (defvar my-foo--change-tracker nil)
;;     (define-minor-mode my-foo-mode
;;       "Fooing like there's no tomorrow."
;;       (if (null my-foo-mode)
;;           (when my-foo--change-tracker
;;             (track-changes-unregister my-foo--change-tracker)
;;             (setq my-foo--change-tracker nil))
;;         (unless my-foo--change-tracker
;;           (setq my-foo--change-tracker
;;                 (track-changes-register
;;                  (lambda (id)
;;                    (track-changes-fetch
;;                     id (lambda (beg end before)
;;                          ..DO THE THING..))))))))

;;; News:

;; Since v1.1:
;;
;; - New function `track-changes-inconsistent-state-p'.

;;; Code:

;; Random ideas:
;; - We could let trackers specify a function to record auxiliary info
;;   about a state.  This would be called from the first before-c-f
;;   and then provided to FUNC.  TeXpresso could use it to avoid needing
;;   the BEFORE string: it could record the total number of bytes
;;   in the "before" state so that from `track-changes-fetch' it could
;;   compute the number of bytes that used to be in BEG/END.
;; - We could also let them provide another function to run in
;;   before-c-f to signal errors if the change is not acceptable,
;;   but contrary to before-c-f it would be called only when we
;;   move t-c--before-beg/end so it scales better when there are
;;   many small changes.

A buffer state is described by a BEG/END/BEFORE triplet which say how to

the BEG..END region with the BEFORE string.

NEXT is the next state object (i.e. a more recent state).
If NEXT is nil it means it's the most recent state and it may be incomplete
\(BEG/END/BEFORE may be nil), in which case those fields will take their

(cl-defun track-changes-register ( signal &key nobefore disjoint immediate)
  "Register a new tracker whose change-tracking function is SIGNAL.
Return the ID of the new tracker.

SIGNAL is a function that will be called with one argument (the tracker ID)
after the current buffer is modified, so that it can react to the change.
Once called, SIGNAL is not called again until `track-changes-fetch'
is called with the corresponding tracker ID.

If optional argument NOBEFORE is non-nil, it means that this tracker does
not need the BEFORE strings (it will receive their size instead).

If optional argument DISJOINT is non-nil, SIGNAL is called every time just
before combining changes from \"distant\" parts of the buffer.
This is needed when combining disjoint changes into one bigger change
is unacceptable, typically for performance reasons.
These calls are distinguished from normal calls by calling SIGNAL with
a second argument which is the distance between the upcoming change and
the previous changes.
BEWARE: In that case SIGNAL is called directly from `before-change-functions'
and should thus be extra careful: don't modify the buffer, don't call a function
that may block, ...
In order to prevent the upcoming change from being combined with the previous
changes, SIGNAL needs to call `track-changes-fetch' before it returns.

By default SIGNAL is called after a change via a 0 seconds timer.
If optional argument IMMEDIATE is non-nil it means SIGNAL should be called
as soon as a change is detected,
BEWARE: In that case SIGNAL is called directly from `after-change-functions'
and should thus be extra careful: don't modify the buffer, don't call a function
that may block, do as little work as possible, ...
When IMMEDIATE is non-nil, the SIGNAL should probably not always call
`track-changes-fetch', since that would defeat the purpose of this library."
