\(process) at their leisure, because the process entry remains in
memory until the user examines it using \\[list-processes].

Otherwise, if `eshell-done-messages-in-minibuffer' is nil, and this
variable is set to t, the only indication the user will have that a
subjob is done is that it will no longer appear in the
