;;;_* What does Eshell offer you?
;;
;; Despite the sheer fact that running an Emacs shell can be fun, here
;; are a few of the unique features offered by Eshell:
;;
;; @ Integration with the Emacs Lisp programming environment
;;
;; @ A high degree of configurability
;;
;; @ The ability to have the same shell on every system Emacs has been
;;   ported to.  Since Eshell imposes no external requirements, and
;;   relies upon only the Lisp functions exposed by Emacs, it is quite
;;   operating system independent.  Several of the common UNIX
;;   commands, such as ls, mv, rm, ln, etc., have been implemented in
;;   Lisp in order to provide a more consistent work environment.
;;
;; For those who might be using an older version of Eshell, version
;; 2.1 represents an entirely new, module-based architecture.  It
;; supports most of the features offered by modern shells.  Here is a
;; brief list of some of its more visible features:
;;
;; @ Command argument completion (tcsh, zsh)
;; @ Input history management (bash)
;; @ Intelligent output scrolling
;; @ Pseudo-devices (such as "/dev/clip" for copying to the clipboard)
;; @ Extended globbing (zsh)
;; @ Argument and globbing predication (zsh)
;; @ I/O redirection to buffers, files, symbols, processes, etc.
;; @ Many niceties otherwise seen only in 4DOS
;; @ Alias functions, both Lisp and Eshell-syntax
;; @ Piping, sequenced commands, background jobs, etc...
;;
;;;_* How to begin
;;
;; To start using Eshell, simply type `M-x eshell'.
;;
;;;_* Philosophy
;;
;; A shell is a layer which metaphorically surrounds the kernel, or
;; heart of an operating system.  This kernel can be seen as an engine
;; of pure functionality, waiting to serve, while the user programs
;; take advantage of that functionality to accomplish their purpose.
;;
;; The shell's role is to make that functionality accessible to the
;; user in an unformed state.  Very roughly, it associates kernel
;; functionality with textual commands, allowing the user to interact
;; with the operating system via linguistic constructs.  Process
;; invocation is perhaps the most significant form this takes, using
;; the kernel's `fork' and `exec' functions.
;;
;; Other programs also interact with the functionality of the kernel,
;; but these user applications typically offer a specific range of
;; functionality, and thus are not classed as "shells" proper.
;; (What they lose in quiddity, they gain in rigidity).
;;
;; Emacs is also a user application, but it does make the
;; functionality of the kernel accessible through an interpreted
;; language -- namely, Lisp.  For that reason, there is little
;; preventing Emacs from serving the same role as a modern shell.  It
;; too can manipulate the kernel in an unpredetermined way to cause
;; system changes.  All it's missing is the shell-ish linguistic
;; model.
;;
;; Enter Eshell.  Eshell translates "shell-like" syntax into Lisp
;; in order to exercise the kernel in the same manner as typical
;; system shells.  There is a fundamental difference here, however,
;; although it may seem subtle at first...
;;
;; Shells like csh and Bourne shell were written several decades ago,
;; in different times, under more restrictive circumstances.  This
;; confined perspective shows itself in the paradigm used by nearly
;; all command-line shells since.  They are linear in conception, byte
;; stream-based, sequential, and confined to movement within a single
;; host machine.
;;
;; Emacs, on the other hand, is more than just a limited translator
;; that can invoke subprocesses and redirect file handles.  It also
;; manages character buffers, windowing frames, network connections,
;; registers, bookmarks, processes, etc.  In other words, it's a very
;; multi-dimensional environment, within which eshell emulates a highly
;; linear methodology.
;;
;; Taking a moment, let's look at how this could affect the future of
;; a shell allowed to develop in such a wider field of play:
;;
;; @ There is no reason why directory movement should be linear, and
;;   confined to a single file-system.  Emacs, through w3 and ange-ftp,
;;   has access to the entire Web.  Why not allow a user to cd to
;;   multiple directories simultaneously, for example?  It might make
;;   some tasks easier, such as diff'ing files separated by very long
;;   pathnames.
;;
;; @ Data sources are available from anywhere Emacs can derive
;;   information from: not just from files or the output of other
;;   processes.
;;
;; @ Multiple shell invocations all share the same environment -- even
;;   the same process list!  It would be possible to have "process
;;   views", so that one buffer is watching standard output, another
;;   standard error, and another the result of standard output grep'd
;;   through a regular expression...
;;
;; @ It is not necessary to "leave" the shell, losing all input and
;;   output history, environment variables, directory stack, etc.
;;   Emacs could save the contents of your eshell environment, and
;;   restore all of it (or at least as much as possible) each time you
;;   restart.  This could occur automatically, without requiring
;;   complex initialization scripts.
;;
;; @ Typos occur all of the time; many of them are repeats of common
;;   errors, such as 'dri' for `dir'.  Since executing non-existent
;;   programs is rarely the intention of the user, eshell could prompt
;;   for the replacement string, and then record that in a database of
;;   known misspellings.  (Note: The typo at the beginning of this
;;   paragraph wasn't discovered until two months after I wrote the
;;   text; it was not intentional).
;;
;; @ Emacs's register and bookmarking facilities can be used for
;;   remembering where you've been, and what you've seen -- to varying
;;   levels of persistence.  They could perhaps even be tied to
;;   specific "moments" during eshell execution, which would include
;;   the environment at that time, as well as other variables.
;;   Although this would require functionality orthogonal to Emacs's
;;   own bookmarking facilities, the interface used could be made to
;;   operate very similarly.
;;
;; This presents a brief idea of what the fuller dimensionality of an
;; Emacs shell could offer.  It's not just the language of a shell
;; that determines how it's used, but also the Weltanschauung
;; underlying its design -- and which is felt behind even the smallest
;; feature.  I would hope the freedom provided by using Emacs as a
;; parent environment will invite rich ideas from others.  It
;; certainly feels as though all I've done so far is to tie down the
;; horse, so to speak, so that he will run at a man's pace.
;;
;;;_* Influences
;;
;; The author of Eshell has been a long-time user of the following
;; shells, all of which contributed to Eshell's design:
;;
;; @ rc
;; @ bash
;; @ zsh
;; @ sh
;; @ 4nt
;; @ csh
