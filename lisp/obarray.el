;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides function for working with obarrays.

;;; Code:

(defconst obarray-default-size 4)
(make-obsolete-variable 'obarray-default-size
                        "obarrays now grow automatically." "30.1")

(defun obarray-size (_ob)
  (declare (obsolete "obarrays now grow automatically." "30.1"))
  obarray-default-size)

;; Donâ€™t use obarray as a variable name to avoid shadowing.
(defun obarray-get (ob name)
  "Return symbol named NAME if it is contained in obarray OB.
Return nil otherwise."
  (intern-soft name ob))

(defun obarray-put (ob name)

Creates and adds the symbol if it doesn't exist."
  (intern name ob))

(defun obarray-remove (ob name)
  "Remove symbol named NAME if it is contained in obarray OB.
Return t on success, nil otherwise."
  (unintern name ob))

(defun obarray-map (fn ob)
  "Call function FN on every symbol in obarray OB and return nil."
  (mapatoms fn ob))
