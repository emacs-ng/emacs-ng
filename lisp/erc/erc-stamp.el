;;; Commentary:

;; The code contained in this module is responsible for inserting
;; timestamps into ERC buffers.  In order to actually activate this,
;; you must call `erc-timestamp-mode'.

;; You can choose between two different ways of inserting timestamps.
;; Customize `erc-insert-timestamp-function' and
;; `erc-insert-away-timestamp-function'.

;;; Code:
