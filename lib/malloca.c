/* The speed critical point in this file is freea() applied to an alloca()
   result: it must be fast, to match the speed of alloca().  The speed of
   mmalloca() and freea() in the other case are not critical, because they
   are only invoked for big memory sizes.
   Here we use a bit in the address as an indicator, an idea by Ondřej Bílka.
   malloca() can return three types of pointers:
     - Pointers ≡ 0 mod 2*sa_alignment_max come from stack allocation.
     - Pointers ≡ sa_alignment_max mod 2*sa_alignment_max come from heap
       allocation.
     - NULL comes from a failed heap allocation.  */
