/* String conversion support.

   Many input methods require access to text surrounding the cursor.
   They may then request that the text editor remove or substitute
   that text for something else, for example when providing the
   ability to ``undo'' or ``edit'' previously composed text.  This is
   most commonly seen in input methods for CJK languages for X Windows,
   and is extensively used throughout Android by input methods for all
   kinds of scripts.

   In addition, these input methods may also need to make detailed
   edits to the content of a buffer.  That is also handled here.  */
