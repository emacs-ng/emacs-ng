     new ranges the users wants to set, and avoid reparse if the new
     ranges is the same as the current one.  Another purpose is to store
     the ranges in charpos (ts api returns ranges in bytepos).  We need
     to use charpos so we don't end up having a range cut into a
     multibyte character.  (See (ref:bytepos-range-pitfall) in treesit.c
     for more detail.)

     treesit-parser-set-included-ranges sets this field;
     treesit-parser-included-ranges directly returns this field, and
     before each reparse, treesit_sync_visible_region uses this to
     calculate a range for the parser that fits in the visible region.

     Trivia: when the parser doesn't have a range set and we call
     ts_parser_included_ranges on it, it doesn't return an empty list,
     but rather return DEFAULT_RANGE.  (A single range where start_byte
     = 0, end_byte = UINT32_MAX).  */

     Note that we don't need to synchronize these positions when
     retrieving them in a function that involves a node: if the node
