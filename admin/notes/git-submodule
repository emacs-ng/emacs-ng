Updating git submodules
=====================================================

Git submodules is configured using autogen.sh
However you will also probably want to manully initialize
any uninitialized submodules using:

git submodule update --init --recursive

To manually update any submodules to match current checkouted HEAD
using:

git submodule update --recursive

Note that `make clean` does this automatically. Also you can
also magit to achieve the same result.
