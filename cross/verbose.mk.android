# Whether $(info ...) works.  This is to work around a bug in GNU Make
# 4.3 and earlier, which implements $(info MSG) via two system calls
# { write (..., "MSG", 3); write (..., "\n", 1); }
# which looks bad when make -j interleaves two of these at about the same time.
#
# Later versions of GNU Make have the 'notintermediate' feature,
# so assume that $(info ...) works if this feature is present.

# The workaround is to use the shell and 'echo' rather than $(info ...).
# The workaround is done only for AM_V_ELC and AM_V_ELN,
# since the bug is not annoying elsewhere.
