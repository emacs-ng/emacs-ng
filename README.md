# Remacs

## Why use new repository ?

Don't replace existing C code for now and instead add additional features with
rust on top of the existing code base. This will reduce the effort when merging
emacs master into this repository.

## Notes

Latest emacs commit is `d228de8a26`.

This fork contains an experimental libvterm support that can be used with
`./configure with_libvterm=yes`.
