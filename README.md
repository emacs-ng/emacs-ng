# emacs-ng

## Motivation

The goal of this fork is to explore new development approaches.

# Why Emacsng

Emacs-ng is an additive native layer over emacs, bringing features like Deno's Javascript and Async I/O environment, Mozilla's Webrender (experimental opt-in feature), and other features in development. emacs-ng's approach is to utilize multiple new development approaches and tools to bring Emacs to the next level. emacs-ng is maintained by a team that loves Emacs and everything it stands for - being totally introspectable, with a fully customizable and free development environment. We want Emacs to be a editor 40+ years from now that has the flexibility and design to keep up with progressive technology.

## Why JavaScript

One of emacs-ng's primary features is integrating the [Deno Runtime](https://deno.land/), which allows execution of JavaScript and Typescript within Emacs. The details of that feature are listed below, however many users would ask themselves **WHY JAVASCRIPT?** JavaScript is an extremely dynamic language that allows for a user to inspect and control their scripting environment. The key to note is that brining in Deno isn't JUST JavaScript - it's an ecosystem of powerful tools and approaches that Emacs just doesn't have currently.

* TypeScript offers an extremely flexible typing system, that allows to user to have compile time control of their scripting, with the flexibility of types "getting out of the way" when not needed.
* Deno uses Google's v8 JavaScript engine, which features an extremely powerful JIT and world-class garbage collector.
* Usage of modern Async I/O utilizing Rust's Tokio library.
* Emacs-ng has WebWorker support, meaning that multiple JavaScript engines can be running in parallel within the editor. The only restriction is that only the 'main' JS Engine can directly call lisp functions.
* Emacs-ng also has WebAssembly support - compile your C module as WebAsm and distribute it to the world. Don't worry about packaging shared libraries or changing module interfaces, everything can be handled and customized by you the user, at the scripting layer. No need to be dependent on native implementation details.

### Performance

v8's world-class JIT offers the potential for massive performance gains. For a simple benchmark (fibonacci), using the following implementations:

``` lisp
(defun fibonacci(n)
  (if (<= n 1)
      n
    (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))
```

``` js
const fib = (n) => {
    if (n <= 1) {
	return n;
    }

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
};
```

emacs-ng's JS implementation clocks in over **50 times** faster than emacs 28 without native-comp for calculating fib(40). With native-comp at level 3, JS clocks in over **15** times faster. This, along with Async I/O from Deno, WebWorkers, and WebAsm, gives you the tools to make Emacs a smoother and faster experience without having to install additional tools to launch as background processes or worry about shared library versions - **full performance with EVERYTHING in the scripting layer**.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

1. You will need
   [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).
   The file `rust-toolchain` indicates the version that gets installed.
   This happens automatically, so don't override the toolchain manually.
   IMPORTANT: Whenever the toolchain updates, you have to reinstall
   rustfmt manually.
   
2. You will need a C compiler and toolchain. On Linux, you can do
   something like:

        apt install build-essential automake clang libclang-dev

   On macOS, you'll need Xcode.

3. Linux:

        apt install texinfo libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev \
          libgif-dev libxpm-dev libgtk-3-dev gnutls-dev \
          libncurses5-dev libxml2-dev libxt-dev

   macOS:

        brew install gnutls texinfo autoconf

    To use the installed version of `makeinfo` instead of the built-in
    (`/usr/bin/makeinfo`) one, you'll need to make sure `/usr/local/opt/texinfo/bin`
    is before `/usr/bin` in `PATH`.
    Mojave install libxml2 headers with: `open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`


If you want to run doomemacs, you will need to compile with `./configure --with-nativecomp`. nativecomp will also require `zlib1g-dev libgccjit-8-dev`

## Building emacsng

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-rust-debug
$ make
```

For a release build, don't pass `--enable-rust-debug`.

The Makefile obeys cargo's RUSTFLAGS variable and additional options
can be passed to cargo with CARGO_FLAGS.

For example:

``` bash
$ make CARGO_FLAGS="-vv" RUSTFLAGS="-Zunstable-options --cfg MARKER_DEBUG"
```

## Running emacsng

You can now run your build:

```bash
./src/emacs
```

If you want to install it, just use

```bash
make install
```

You may need to run sudo make install depending on your system configuration. 

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. We try to maintain a list of "new contributor" friendly issues tagged with "good first issue".

# Features

## Javascript
This code is a strictly additive layer, it changes no elisp functionality, and should be able to merge upstream patches cleanly. JS tests can be run by building the editor and executing `./src/emacs --batch -l test/js/bootstrap.el`.

### Typescript
emacs-ng supports native typescript. In order to have your script evaluated as typescript, it just needs to end in a typescript extension (like .ts) when using `(eval-js-file)`, or you can pass it the argument `:typescript t`. You can also evaluate anonymous scripts as typescript using `(eval-js "let x: string = '5';" :typescript t)`. If your typescript fails to compile, those functions will throw elisp errors that you can address within your program. Currently, emacs-ng does not provide type definition files for elisp functions, however we welcome contributions to that effort. If you call lisp functions within typescript, ensure you add the following line to your module to ensure that the typescript compiler knows about the global lisp variable: `declare var lisp: any;`


The high level concept here is to allow full control of emacs-ng via the javascript layer. In order to avoid conflict between the elisp and javascript layers, only one scripting engine will be running at a time. elisp is the "authoritative" layer, in that the javascript will invoke elisp functions to interact with the editor. This is done via a special object in javascript called `lisp`. An example of it's usage would be:

### Interacting with buffers and symbols

``` js
let buffer = lisp.get_buffer_create("mybuf");
```

The lisp object uses reflection to invoke the equivalent of `(get-buffer-create "mybuf")`. In this example, get-buffer-create returns a buffer object. In order to represent this, we use a technique called proxying, in which we give a reference to the elisp object to an internal field of a javascript object. This field is only accessible by the native layer, so it cannot be tampered with in the javascript layer. When javascript calls subsequent functions using `buffer`, a translation layer will extract the elisp object and invoke it on the function.

Primitive data structures will be converted automatically. More complex data structures can be converted to native javascript objects via a call to a special function called `json`

``` js
let qcname = lisp.keywords.name; // Will return an object representing :name
let myList = lisp.list(qcname, 3);
console.log(myList); // prints { nativeProxy : true }
console.log(myList.json()); // prints { name: 3 }, defaulting to the assumption this list is a plist
```

It's important to note that once you convert to a native js object via a call to `json`, your mutations do not affect the lisp layer.

``` js
let result = lisp.buffer_string();
result += "my addition"; // This operation did not edit any lisp object.
let myList = lisp.list(qcname, 3);
let jsond = myList.json();
jsond.name = 4; // This did not edit a lisp object.
```

### Using Async I/O

We expose the async IO functionality included with deno. Users can fetch data async from their local file system, or  the network. They can use that data to interact with the editor. An example would be:

``` js
const json = fetch("https://api.github.com/users/denoland")
.then((response) => { return response.json(); });

const txt = Deno.readTextFile("./test.json");

Promise.all([json, text])
    .then((data) => {
        let buffer = lisp.get_buffer_create('hello');
        const current = lisp.current_buffer();
        lisp.set_buffer(buffer);
        lisp.insert(JSON.stringify(data[0]));
        lisp.insert(data[1]);
        console.log(lisp.buffer_string());
        lisp.set_buffer(current);
    });
```
This example assumes you have a json file named `test.json` in your current directory.

Lambdas are converted automatically between the two languages via proxying. You can use  this to set timers, or to add hooks. This example features the lisp.symbols object, which returns a proxy to the quoted key. lisp.setq functions similarly to `(setq ....)`

``` js
lisp.add_hook(lisp.symbols.text_mode_hook, () => {
    lisp.setq(lisp.symbols.foo, "3");
});

// Or set timer with arguments...
lisp.run_with_timer(lisp.symbols.t, 1, (a, b) => {
    console.log('hello ' + a);
    lisp.print(b);
    return 3;
}, 3, lisp.make.alist({x: 3}));
```

The user can also define functions via `defun` that will call back into javascript. Like in normal defun, DOCSTRING and the INTERACTIVE decl are optional. This example features both docstring and interactive

``` js
lisp.defun({
    name: "my-funcntion",
    docString: "This is my docstring",
    interactive: true,
    args: "P\nbbuffer:",
    func: (a, b) => console.log('hello buffer!')
});
```

### Module Importing

We also leverage module loading. Javascript can be invoked anonymously via `(eval-js "....")`, or a module can be loaded via `(eval-js-file "./my-file.js")`. Loading js as a module enables ES6 module imports to be used:

``` js
import { operation } from './ops.js';

const results = operation();
// ...
```

Though tokio is driving the io operations, execution of javascript is strictly controlled by the lisp layer. This is accomplished via a lisp timer. When the timer ticks, we advance the event loop of javascript one iteration.

While a LispObject is being proxy'd by javascript, we add that lisp object to a rooted lisp data structure, and add a special reference to the proxy in javascript called a `WeakRef`. We use `WeakRef`s to manage when javascript objects are no longer used by the javascript runtime and can be removed from our lisp GC root.

### Error Handling

When executing javascript, invoking lisp functions may result in lisp throwing errors. For example:

``` js
const cons = lisp.cons(); // oh no, no arguments!
```

In this example, lisp.cons will throw a lisp layer error due to not being provided arguments. That error will be caught by the lisp/javascript intermediate layer, and a javascript exception will be thrown, with the value of (error-message-string). This can be caught at this js layer via a standard try/catch, or using a promise error handler.

``` js
try {
    const cons = lisp.cons(); //will throw
} catch (e) {
    // perform fallback.
}
```

### Access Control

The user can control what permissions javascript is granted when the runtime is initialized by a call to (js-initalize &REST). The user must call this function prior to javascript being executed for it to take effect. Otherwise, the js environment will initialize with default values.

``` lisp
(js-initialize :allow-net nil :allow-read nil :allow-write nil :allow-run nil :js-tick-rate 0.5)
```

This example, the user has denied javascript the ability to access the network, the file system, or spawn processes. They have increased the tick rate to 0.5.

In order to communicate errors to lisp, the user can provide an error handler at first initialization:

``` lisp
(js-initialize ..... :js-error-handler 'handler)
```

If the user does not provide an error handler, the default behavior will be to invoke (error ...) on any uncaught javascript errors.

### WebWorkers and WebAsm

We also support WebWorkers, meaning that you can run javascript in seperate threads. Note that WebWorkers cannot interact with the lisp VM, however they can use Deno for async I/O. See test/js/webWorkers.js for an example.

Web Assembly allows you to perform things normally handled by native libraries with easy distribution. Want to manipulate sqlite3? Use the [deno sqlite wasm package](https://deno.land/x/sqlite@v2.3.2/mod.ts)

``` js 
import { DB } from "https://deno.land/x/sqlite@v2.3.2/mod.ts";

const db = new DB("test.db");
db.query("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT)");

const name = "David";
db.query("INSERT INTO people (name) VALUES (?)", [name]);
for (const [name] of db.query("SELECT name FROM people")) {
    console.log(name);
}

db.close();
```
