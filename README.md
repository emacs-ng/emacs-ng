## Intro

emacs-ng is based off of the `master` branch of emacs, and regularly
merges using Github Actions(Runs at 00:00, only on Saturday).

The last merged commit is `35d3927859` (01 26 2025).

## Motivation

The goal of this fork is to explore new development approaches. To
accomplish this, we aim to maintain an inclusive and innovative
environment. The project is not about replacing elisp with a more
popular language like Javascript. We just want to make emacs more
approachable for people who don't like lisp as much as we do.

Contributions are welcome from anyone and we are always happy to
invite new people to the project. We are open towards interesting
ideas to make emacs better.

## Why Emacs-ng

This project should be considered an additive native layer over emacs,
bringing features like Deno's Javascript and Async I/O environment,
Mozilla's Webrender, and other features in development. emacs-ng's
approach is to utilize multiple new development approaches and tools
to bring Emacs to the next level. It is maintained by a team that
loves Emacs and everything it stands for - being totally
introspectable, with a fully customizable and free development
environment. We want Emacs to be a editor 40+ years from now that has
the flexibility and design to keep up with progressive technology.

## Contributing

Emacs combined with the rust ecosystem brings a lot of
possibilities. If you have any idea for a new feature, just open an
issue before starting work so we can give you some feedback.

We try to maintain a list of "new contributor" friendly issues tagged
with "good first issue". You should also take a look at our
[handbook](https://emacs-ng.github.io/emacs-ng/handbook/getting-started/).

## Features

### Webrender

[WebRender](https://github.com/servo/webrender) is a GPU-based 2D
rendering engine written in Rust from Mozilla. Firefox, the research
web browser Servo, and other GUI frameworks draw with it. emacs-ng use
it as a new experimental graphic backend to leverage GPU hardware.

### Dynamic modules

> **Warning**
> **This feature is currently unmaintained**

Allow dynamic modules to access *more of Emacs's internals*. Dynamic
modules can be written to take advantage of these extra
functionalities when they are available, while at the same time being
*fully compatible* with vanilla Emacs.

### Deno/Javascript

> **Note**
> **This feature is currently outdated and been disabled. However there is**
> **[this](https://github.com/emacs-ng/emacs-ng/pull/463) to bring it back.**

One of emacs-ng's primary features is integrating the [Deno
Runtime](https://deno.land/), which allows execution of JavaScript and
Typescript within Emacs. The details of that feature are listed below,
however many users would ask themselves **WHY JAVASCRIPT?** JavaScript
is an extremely dynamic language that allows for a user to inspect and
control their scripting environment. The key to note is that bringing
in Deno isn't JUST JavaScript - it's an ecosystem of powerful tools
and approaches that Emacs just doesn't have currently.

* TypeScript offers an extremely flexible typing system, that allows
  to user to have compile time control of their scripting, with the
  flexibility of types "getting out of the way" when not needed.
* Deno uses Google's v8 JavaScript engine, which features an extremely
  powerful JIT and world-class garbage collector.
* Usage of modern Async I/O utilizing Rust's Tokio library.
* Emacs-ng has WebWorker support, meaning that multiple JavaScript
  engines can be running in parallel within the editor. The only
  restriction is that only the 'main' JS Engine can directly call lisp
  functions.
* Emacs-ng also has WebAssembly support - compile your C module as
  WebAsm and distribute it to the world. Don't worry about packaging
  shared libraries or changing module interfaces, everything can be
  handled and customized by you the user, at the scripting layer. No
  need to be dependent on native implementation details.

#### Performance

v8's world-class JIT offers the potential for large performance
gains. Async I/O from Deno, WebWorkers, and WebAsm, gives you the
tools to make Emacs a smoother and faster experience without having to
install additional tools to launch as background processes or worry
about shared library versions.
