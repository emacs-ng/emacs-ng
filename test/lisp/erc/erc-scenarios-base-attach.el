;;; Commentary:

;; See also: `erc-scenarios-base-channel-buffer-revival'.
;;
;; ERC 5.5 silently dropped support for the ancient option
;; `erc-query-on-unjoined-chan-privmsg' because the tangled logic in
;; and around the function `erc-auto-query' made it difficult to
;; divine its purpose.
;;
;; Based on the name, it was thought this option likely involved
;; controlling the creation of query buffers for unsolicited messages
;; from users with whom you don't share a common channel.  However,
;; additional spelunking has recently revealed that it was instead
;; meant to service a feature offered by most bouncers that sends
;; PRIVMSGs directed at a channel you're no longer in and that you
;; haven't received a(nother) JOIN message for.  IOW, this is meant to
;; support the following sequence of events:
;;
;;   1. /detach #chan
;;   2. kill buffer #chan or reconnect in new Emacs session
;;   3. /playbuffer #chan
;;
;; Note that the above slash commands are bouncer-specific aliases.
;;
;; Interested users can find more info by looking at this change set
;; from the ancient CVS repo:

;;   * new function erc-BBDB-NICK to handle nickname anotation ...
;;   * Applied antifuchs/mhp patches, the latest on erc-help, unmodified
;;   * New variable: erc-reuse-buffers default to t.
;;   * Modified erc-generate-new-buffer-name to use it. it checks if
;;     server and port are the same, then one can assume thats the same
;;     channel/query target again.
