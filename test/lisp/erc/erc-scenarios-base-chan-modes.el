;; Previously, ERC would attempt to parse a nullary channel mode as if
;; it were a status prefix update, which led to a wrong-type error.
;; This test does not address similar collisions with unary modes,
;; such as "MODE +q foo!*@*", but it should.

;; This asserts proper recognition of nonstandard prefixes advertised

;; `multi-prefix' extension, we can't easily sync a user's channel
;; membership status on receipt of a 352/353 by parsing the "flags"
;; parameter because even though servers remember multiple prefixes,
;; they only ever return the one with the highest rank.  For example,
;; if on receipt of a 352, we were to "update" someone we believe to
;; be @+ by changing them to a to @, we'd be guilty of willful
;; munging.  And if they later lose that @, we'd then see them as null
;; when in fact they're still +.  However, we *could* use a single
;; degenerate prefix to "validate" an existing record to ensure
;; correctness of our processing logic, but it's unclear how such a
;; discrepancy ought to be handled beyond asking the user to file a
;; bug.
