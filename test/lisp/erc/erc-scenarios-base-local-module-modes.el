;;; Commentary:

;; A local module doubles as a minor mode whose mode variable and
;; associated local data can withstand service disruptions.
;; Unfortunately, the current implementation is too unwieldy to be
;; made public because it doesn't perform any of the boiler plate
;; needed to save and restore buffer-local and "network-local" copies
;; of user options.  Ultimately, a user-friendly framework must fill
;; this void if third-party local modules are ever to become
;; practical.
;;
;; The following tests all use `sasl' because, as of ERC 5.5, it's the
;; only local module.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert-x)
(eval-and-compile
  (let ((load-path (cons (ert-resource-directory) load-path)))
    (require 'erc-scenarios-common)))

(require 'erc-sasl)

;; After quitting a session for which `sasl' is enabled, you
;; disconnect and toggle `erc-sasl-mode' off.  You then reconnect
;; using an alternate nickname.  You again disconnect and reconnect,
;; this time immediately, and the mode stays disabled.  Finally, you
;; once again disconnect, toggle the mode back on, and reconnect.  You
;; are authenticated successfully, just like in the initial session.
;;
;; This is meant to show that a user's local mode settings persist
;; between sessions.  It also happens to show (in round four, below)
;; that a server renicking a user on 001 after a 903 is handled just
;; like a user-initiated renick, although this is not the main thrust.
