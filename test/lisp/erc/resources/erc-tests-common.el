;;; Commentary:

;; This file must *not* contain any `ert-deftest' definitions.  See
;; top of test/lisp/erc/erc-tests.el for loading example.
;;
;; Environment variables:
;;
;;  `ERC_PACKAGE_NAME': Name of the installed ERC package currently
;;   running.  ERC needs this in order to load the same package in
;;   tests that run in a subprocess.  Necessary even when the package
;;   name is `erc' and not something like `erc-49860'.
;;
;;  `ERC_TESTS_INIT': The name of an alternate init file.  Mainly for
;;   integrations tests involving starter kits.
;;
;;  `ERC_TESTS_SNAPSHOT_SAVE': When set, ERC saves the current test's
;;   snapshots to disk.
;;
